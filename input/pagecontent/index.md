## Introduction
Welcome to the Aerospace Medicine Implementation Guide (IG) for the Synthea Synthetic Patient Generation utility. This guide documents a standardized approach for modeling and exchanging health and medical data in aerospace environments using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) specification. The goal of this IG is to bridge the gap between terrestrial healthcare informatics and the emerging needs of space medicine by enabling consistent, interoperable simulation and data exchange across mission profiles, devices, and care environments.

This guide is intended for developers, researchers, mission planners, medical device manufacturers, and clinicians who are designing, evaluating, or simulating health monitoring systems in aerospace domains—from commercial space tourism to long-duration crewed missions. It provides the data schemas, usage patterns, and practical mappings needed to support synthetic patient generation and interoperability across the continuum of spaceflight health data—from pre-launch screening to in-flight telemetry to post-mission rehabilitation.

## Design Philosophy
The design philosophy of this guide is grounded in a central thesis:

> A hospital ICU bed, an astronaut's spacesuit, and NASA mission control all share a common imperative: to continuously monitor, analyze, and act upon a human’s vital signs in a life-critical environment.

If this thesis holds, then the boundaries between Earth-based clinical care and spaceflight operational medicine begin to blur. The underlying data requirements of intensive care units—real-time biometric streaming, automated alerting, device interoperability, and physician oversight—are strikingly similar to those required for safeguarding astronauts in microgravity or hostile environments. Conversely, the rugged, autonomous, and adaptive systems developed for human spaceflight offer a promising model for remote, resource-constrained, and austere healthcare delivery on Earth.

This dual-use insight informs the architecture of this IG. It proposes that spacesuits, spacecraft life support systems, and mission control centers should function as distributed, mobile intensive care environments. To enable this, they must speak the same language as Earth-based healthcare systems—namely, the FHIR standard that underpins modern electronic health record (EHR) systems, clinical decision support tools, and remote patient monitoring platforms.

By modeling aerospace medicine scenarios using FHIR resources, we unlock a number of benefits:

- We align space medicine data with terrestrial clinical systems, allowing seamless integration with hospital EMRs, biosurveillance platforms, and public health registries.

- We enable robust simulation of mission-specific medical events using synthetic patients, supporting validation, training, and protocol development without exposing real-world health data.

- We promote interoperability across vendors and systems—from wearable sensors in suits, to rovers and habitats, to ground-based mission support teams—by anchoring them to a shared, standards-based data model.

This guide includes scenario-specific implementations of FHIR resources such as Observation, Encounter, Procedure, Condition, Device, and MedicationAdministration, with extensions and constraints suitable for the aerospace domain. Use cases include:

- Continuous physiologic monitoring in microgravity

- Radiation exposure tracking during lunar EVAs

- Health assessments before and after reentry

- Emergency response modeling in pressurized rovers or habitats

Modeling long-term changes in cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, or neurovestibular health from partial gravity exposure

Ultimately, this IG is not only a tool for simulating patients in space—it is a statement about the convergence of aerospace and clinical medicine, and a call to design our next-generation health systems with both Earth and space in mind. As we prepare for commercial space tourism, lunar occupations, and human Mars missions, the infrastructure we build must be informed by the highest standards of safety, interoperability, and resilience.
